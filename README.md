# HSRD
the HybridSAR Road Dataset (HSRD)
## Overview
The HybridSAR Road Dataset (HSRD) is a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate road segmentation tasks using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. This dataset addresses the scarcity of high-resolution annotated SAR data by integrating real and synthesized SAR datasets. HSRD includes sub-meter resolution SAR images and corresponding road labels, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in remote sensing, urban planning, and disaster management.

## Dataset Composition
The HSRD dataset comprises three main components:

**SpaceNet 6 Road (SN6R) Dataset**: This dataset includes high-resolution SAR images and road labels sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The SAR images are derived from the SpaceNet 6 Challenge, covering the city of Rotterdam.

**DG-SAR Dataset**: Synthesized from the DeepGlobe (DG) optical dataset using an EO2SAR translation model. This dataset provides SAR-like images generated from high-resolution electro-optical (EO) images.

**SN3-SAR Dataset**: Synthesized from the SpaceNet 3 (SN3) optical dataset using an EO2SAR translation model. Similar to DG-SAR, this dataset offers SAR-like images generated from high-resolution EO images.
